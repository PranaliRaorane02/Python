# Python
Hi! This repository contains my projects in Python. Over the course of a few months, I learned basic coding skills in Python like statements, loop iterations and functions. Using these skills, I further learned about Python GUI and worked on a few projects related to that. I only just discovred the GitHub community and felt like it was a great place to organize and showcase my coding work.
